## Software Setup

### Details

There are many different programs you can use to run C++ code. However, in this workshop we will be using Microsoft's [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). It is a lightweight integrated development environment (IDE) that has a lot of customization options.

### Visual Studio
After installing VSCode, you have to setup the environment for C++. First, you should check whether or not your computer has C++ installed. You will need to open the terminal, a quick access to your computer's command system.

### Terminal

You can either open the terminal by going to the top of VSCode and clicking on Terminal->New Terminal. There are also keyboard shortcuts that are displayed below.


#### Windows
<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd>

#### Mac
<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>~</kbd>

#### Linux
Look up for your specific Linux system

Now with your terminal open, type in "c++ -v" and hit enter to see the version of C++ installed on your 
device. If nothing shows up, please look up how to download C++ for your respective OS/medium. 
With this, you are now able to move on.
